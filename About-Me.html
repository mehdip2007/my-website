                    My name is Mehdi Pourhadi. I'm 26 years old. I grew up in Tehran. Graduated in Computer programming. Here's my Linux story, and how I got acquainted with it: once my brother came home with  Fedora , one of the most famous Linux distros, installed on his laptop; I asked him about it as I was using Windows XP back then. I played with it for a while and decided it was not my thing (still trying to use it but can't);  but when he introduced  Ubuntu  to me, I said "that's it." Ubuntu was more friendly and easy to use. After a while I got to like Linux more and more; having tried other distros, I found  Linux mint which is currently the #1 in the top 100 in  Distrowatch ; I knew then that I had finally found the OS I really needed.
